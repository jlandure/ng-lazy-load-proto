ng-lazy-load-proto
==================

An example showing use of ui-router-extras futureStates with ocLazyLoad to lazy load a requirejs module, which in turn registers an angular module, which in turn loads the new ui-router states.

Inspired from ui-router-lazy-example https://github.com/kbdaitch/ui-router-lazy-example
